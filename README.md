### scripts/
Contains scripts used on the server side to run the chat server.

The directory structure is assumed to be:
```
  /local
      /bin
      /include
      /lib
  /chat
      chat
      kill.sh
      libPserver.so
      run.sh
      show.sh
  ```
Where `local\` is where the poco libraries are installed and 
`chat` contains the scripts and the chat code.
